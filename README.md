# DijkstraVisualizer
A project that simulates dijkstra algorithm and visualizes that path step by step.

**1) Setup to use this program:**\
     - Download or Clone this repository. \
     - Download JUNG library from here -> [JUNG lib.](http://jung.sourceforge.net/download.html)\
     - EXtract the jars and add them to the project dependencies.
     
     
**2) Program demonstration:**\
     -The first window that appears when the system runs is a tab that allows the user to input the description of the graph. It asks for the number of vertices and edges. It also asks for the source and destination nodes for the Dijkstra algorithm and graph type (directed/undirected).
